# ReviewApp

ReviewApp is a Django project for a community site built around sharing and reviewing projects. Users can browse other members’ work, leave reviews with media attachments, and communicate via direct messages.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Authentication:** Custom login form supporting either username or email, with authenticated-user redirection.
- **Review posting:** Submit reviews with images or videos, filter by category, sort by popularity or date, and like other users’ posts.
- **Profiles:** Editable bios and avatars, public profile pages with a list of authored reviews.
- **Messaging:** Direct messaging between users with rate limiting and read-state tracking.
- **Audit logging:** Automatic logs for user creation, login activity, review lifecycle events, and admin email notifications when a new account is created.
- **Security:** Login attempt throttling via django-axes, CSRF/XSS safeguards, Argon2 password hashing, and input sanitization.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Django 4.2  
- SQLite (default for development)  
- django-axes, django-extensions, Pillow, whitenoise  
- Frontend: Django templates with Bootstrap-based static assets  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+  
- pip and venv available  

### Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run migrations and create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser  # create an admin user
   ```
4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
5. Open the following URL to view the top page and log-in screen:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Configure via `.env` or another method:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=admin@example.com  # optional
```

If `ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` is set, the app emails the administrator when a new user registers (requires Replit environment tokens when running on Replit).

---

## 🧩 Development Notes

* Static assets: run `python manage.py collectstatic` to populate `staticfiles_build/`.
* Tests: run `python manage.py test`.
* Caching: Message rate limiting uses Django’s cache; the default in-memory backend works during development.

## ☁️ Deployment

### Current Environment (Replit)

The project is currently hosted on **Replit**, providing a convenient cloud-based development and SSH environment.
Due to Replit’s free-tier limitations, the app **sleeps when inactive** and may not run 24/7.
However, all authentication and review features remain fully functional when active.

### Previous Deployment (Vercel)

The project was **previously deployed on Vercel** for front-end testing and demonstration.
Vercel was used to host the public-facing interface, while Replit now serves as the main full-stack environment for backend development and database operations.

If the Replit instance is inactive, please refer to the GitHub repository or screenshots in the `/screenshots` directory for UI reference.

---

## 🧭 Note for Reviewers (Universities / Recruiters)

This repository demonstrates full-stack Django development, including authentication, CRUD operations, security configurations, and deployment workflows across both **Vercel** and **Replit** environments.
As Replit projects may sleep during inactivity, please check the source code or screenshots for verification.
Live demonstration access can be provided upon request.
